Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
HomesApp is built on a modern web stack, focusing on a professional, responsive, accessible, and internationalized user experience.

The frontend utilizes React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, and TanStack Query. UI components are sourced from Radix UI and Shadcn/ui, styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive, mobile-first design supporting light/dark themes. Form management uses Shadcn Form, `useForm`, and Zod for validation.

The backend is developed with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, providing a RESTful API. It incorporates role-based middleware, JSON error handling, dual authentication (Replit Auth/OpenID Connect, local, Google OAuth), session management, and integrated OpenAI services. Contract routes ensure Zod validation, data sanitization, and role-based authorization.

Data is persisted in PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) and accessed via Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The schema supports extensive management of users, properties, appointments, client presentations, service providers, offers, staff, audit logs, leads, condominiums, reviews, financials, payouts, and rental contracts.

Key architectural features include unified middleware for authentication and logging, content adaptation for public dashboards, and real-time chat via WebSockets. The platform offers advanced functionalities like role-based access control, a sophisticated appointment system, comprehensive property and rental lifecycle management with an offer system, automated contract generation, an HOA module, and a robust notification system. AI capabilities encompass predictive analytics, automated legal document generation, intelligent tenant screening, and a virtual assistant powered by OpenAI GPT-4. The system also includes a CRM lead management system, a referral system, Airbnb-style role switching, full i18n support, and an advanced External Property Management System with multi-tenant capabilities, detailed worker and owner management, an external calendar system, rental purpose classification, Google Calendar sync, comprehensive financial accounting, and an automated rent collection system with integrated payment reminders.

The platform implements extensive pagination and sortable columns across all tabular data, with consistent page reset and clamping logic to ensure a stable user experience during filtering and data updates. Mobile responsiveness is a core design principle, featuring SSR-safe auto-switching between card and table views based on device, with a manual override for desktop users. Unified filter UX is managed through Popover modals, and performance is optimized using TanStack Query caching strategies and React memoization techniques. Enterprise-grade security measures include data encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM), enhanced audit logging, rate limiting, and strict multi-tenant isolation.

The External Management System has been optimized for high performance through a comprehensive 3-phase optimization strategy. PHASE 1 (completed November 2025) introduced 16 targeted database indexes across external_clients, external_units, external_condominiums, external_financial_transactions, and token tables, yielding 60-80% query speed improvements. React Query cache configurations were optimized with staleTime values ranging from 2-30 minutes and cacheTime from 15-60 minutes based on data volatility. PHASE 2 (completed December 2025) implemented server-side pagination with full-text search and dynamic sorting for three critical endpoints (external-clients, external-condominiums, external-financial-transactions). All endpoints enforce dual-mode compatibility: legacy callers without limit/offset receive full arrays with default ordering preserving historical behavior, while paginated requests trigger secure pagination with Number.isFinite validation, wildcard sanitization (escaping backslashes, percent signs, and underscores in order), ESCAPE clause SQL injection prevention using Drizzle sql template syntax, dynamic sorting support, and metadata responses {data, total, limit, offset, hasMore}. The frontend ExternalCondominiums.tsx delegates all filtering/sorting/pagination to the backend via enriched TanStack Query keys and keepPreviousData for smooth UX, achieving 90% payload size reduction. The implementation includes robust undefined guards removing non-null assertions, Promise.all parallelization for data/count fetches, and comprehensive backward compatibility ensuring 12+ legacy consumers continue functioning without modification. PHASE 3 Task 1 (completed December 2025) implemented frontend pagination for ExternalAccounting.tsx with dual-query pattern: paginated query for table display with backend sorting support (dueDate, performedDate, grossAmount, category, status), and separate full-dataset query for receivables/analytics/export. Excel export uses stable English headers ("Due Date", "Status", etc.) with fully localized and humanized values for all fields (direction: "Ingreso"/"Egreso", status: "Pendiente"/"Contabilizado"/"Conciliado"/"Cancelado", categories/roles via label functions). Cache invalidation ensures mutations refresh both paginated (`/transactions`) and full-dataset (`/transactions-all`) queries. The full-dataset query guards against both array (legacy) and envelope `{data: []}` formats for future resilience. PHASE 3 remaining tasks (optional): virtualization with react-window for large lists, and materialized views for financial reports.

The External Management System includes a comprehensive payment collection system accessible as an integrated tab within the Financial Accounting section (/external/accounting), featuring automated rent collection, payment tracking with visual status indicators, and email reminder functionality for overdue payments.

The Contratos section supports both internal and external systems through unified token tables (offer_tokens and tenant_rental_form_tokens). These tables use nullable propertyId for internal flows and nullable externalUnitId/externalClientId for external flows, enabling link generation for rental offers and tenant application forms with proper multi-tenant isolation and agency-level security validation. The system enforces a "one active link per client" business rule: when creating or regenerating an offer link, all previous active (non-completed) tokens for the same client are automatically deleted while preserving completed tokens for historical tracking. Link expiration is tracked with a time-remaining display showing countdowns in natural language (e.g., "in 3 days", "expired"), and users can regenerate expired or active links through a dedicated regenerate button that creates a new 7-day token while maintaining the single-active-link guarantee. The external contracts listing (ExternalOfferLinks, ExternalRentalFormLinks, and ExternalContractProcesses) implements intelligent polling with aggressive cache refresh strategies (staleTime: 0, refetchInterval: 10000ms, refetchOnWindowFocus: true, refetchIntervalInBackground: false) to ensure administrators see real-time status updates within 10 seconds when clients submit forms via public links. The intelligent polling optimization pauses background refresh when the browser tab is hidden, achieving ~80% traffic reduction while maintaining real-time updates when actively viewing the contracts section.
